# The TCP/IP Model: A Practical Guide  

This repository is a hands-on guide to understanding the **TCP/IP model**, the framework that actually powers modern internet communication. Instead of staying in the abstract, we break down each layer of the stack into **tangible, working examples** that you can build and run.  

## What is This Project?  
The goal of this project is to **demystify network communication** by exploring the four layers of the TCP/IP model. Each layer—Link, Internet, Transport, and Application—will be explained not only in theory but also in practice.  

Where the OSI model provides a helpful teaching tool, the TCP/IP model represents the **real-world protocols and mechanisms** that move data across networks today. This guide bridges both: we’ll acknowledge OSI concepts for context, but focus on how TCP/IP works in practice.  

## The "Hands-On" Philosophy  
Networking often feels abstract. What does it really mean for IP to "route packets"? How does TCP "guarantee delivery"?  

This guide is built on the belief that the best way to understand these questions is to **build the answers yourself**. You’ll use tools like:  
- **Tinkercad** for simple hardware/network simulations.  
- **Python scripts** to model protocol logic.  
- **Packet capture tools** (e.g., Wireshark) to see real traffic in action.  

By experimenting with these layers, we’ll make the invisible processes of the internet **visible and understandable**.  

## Approach  
We’ll move layer by layer, combining:  
- **Clear, concise articles** explaining concepts.  
- **Hands-on labs and code** that show protocols in action.  
- **Reflections** to question assumptions and deepen understanding.  

Our aim: to peel back the curtain on how the internet really works, one protocol and one experiment at a time.
